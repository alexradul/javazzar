## Overview
Javazzar (formerly Rebel for StarUML) is a powerful and time-saving code generator for modern Java, delivered as an extension for [StarUML](https://staruml.io/).

It can do different things: 
* transform your domain model into JPA entities,
* output model documentation into Swagger annotations, 
* create Spring Controllers, Services and Repositories for your domain classes 
* or let you customize the mapping of your classes into different data formats using Jackson annotations. 

Also, it preserves your changes to the generated source code.

## Installation
Javazzar is distributed through the official StarUML extension registry. To install it, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [StarUML](https://staruml.io/)
2. Start the StarUML
3. Open StarUML's Extension Manager by selecting Tools -> Extension Manager
4. Type 'Javazzar' in the Search field
5. Press install button of the extension

## Generating Code 
To generate code, you need to have a StarUML project with a domain model. You can create a new project or open an existing one.

1. Using StarUML Property editor, set the stereotype of the project main package to `root`.
   In this way we define a starting point for the code generation process.
2. Define the base package for your project. Javazzar allows you to set a custom base package for your project, using the _Javazzar Property Editor_.
3. Define a destination folder for the generated sources. A destination folder for the generated Java code is set from StarUML main menu ```Javazzar -> Configure -> Project Codebase```. If not set, the Javazzar will prompt you to choose destination folder by opening file select dialog.
4. Select ```Javazzar -> Generate``` from the menu to generate code, or use the shortcut key ```F5``` instead.

## Benefits
### Reducing development complexity
When modeling your domain, it's enough to mark a class persistent and Javazzar will turn it into a JPA entity. You don't need to think about all the different annotations and details you need to apply, you keep your thoughts at higher level of abstractions while already making a step closer to production! 
### Clear Design
If you focus on design - and not on low-level details, there are great chances you will have a clear picture and define a good distribution of responsibilities between your components.
### Fast Development
As soon as your design is complete, your domain concepts are already transformed into Java source code. They are persistent. And marshaled into JSON. No coding needed.
### Smooth Maintenance
You change the model and let Javazzar propagate changes to your application.
### Team Communication
A visual model - dictionary in front of your team members, will make their mutual reference point and will serve as an enabler of clear and focused discussions.
### Personal Motivation
If people perform their everyday work more smoothly, there are great chances they will enjoy it more and will be more productive.
### Best Practices
Java code generated by Javazzar often contains some best practices that have been gathered through years of experience.
